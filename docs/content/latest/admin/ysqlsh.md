## Overview

`ysqlsh` is a command line interface (CLI), or shell, for interacting with YugaByte DB through [YSQL](../../api/ysql/). It is derived from [`psql`](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/11/app-psql.html), the PostgreSQL shell.

## Download

`ysqlsh` is installed as part of YugaByte DB and is located in the bin directory of YugaByte home.

## Example

```sh
$ ./bin/ysqlsh
```

```
ysqlsh (11.2)
Type "help" for help.

postgres=#
```

## Defaults

`ysqlsh` defaults the following flags so that the user does not have to specify them.

```
-h 127.0.0.1 
-p 5433 
-U postgres
```
